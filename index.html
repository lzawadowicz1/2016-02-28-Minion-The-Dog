        <p> I  am a dog. I have no idea about the universe. I don't know how it all began.
        I don't know how I will end. I don't know anything about anthropology or the great
        accomplishments of humanity. I don't know about war, or spirituality, or religion,
        or theology, or philosophy. I don't know capitalism or communism or any of the other
        isms that the snow colored men on the big people screen talk about. I don't know about
        human suffering, or broken hearts, or about the ever looming threat of death. But there
        is one thing I do know. That dog from across the street is going DOWN. </p>
